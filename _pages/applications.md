Thank you for your interest in joining my group!
I receive many inquiries from prospective students, and while I value each one, it's difficult to respond to everyone individually. Below, I've provided answers to some common questions.

## How to apply as a student?

If you’re interested in pursuing a Master’s or PhD under my supervision, I kindly ask that you review [this page](https://www.uvic.ca/graduate/admissions/how-to-apply/index.php) before reaching out.

When you email me, please include a clear description of your research question, along with your CV, transcript, a motivation statement, and, if applicable, one of your research papers. Unfortunately, I may not be able to respond if this information is missing.

To indicate that you’ve read this page, please start your email subject line with [MSApp:] for Master’s applications or [PhDApp:] for PhD applications. Thank you!

## What about visiting?

Yes, I’m happy to host curious and self-motivated visiting students.
If you're interested, please email me directly with your CV and transcript. Kindly note that most of my projects require a minimum commitment of six months. Please visit [here](https://www.uvic.ca/research-services//info-for/visiting-researchers/index.php) for more information.

## How to apply as a postdoc?

I am not currently accepting postdocs. If I decide to recruit in the future, I will update this information here.

## How do you evaluate applicants?

I prioritize applicants who demonstrate strong math and programming skills as well as a [growth mindset](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance?subtitle=en).
Please highlight relevant course grades, competition awards, publications, and examples of your ability to learn and adapt.

## What if I'm just getting started?

Here are some books I highly recommend for getting started:

- **Goodfellow, I. (2016).** [*Deep Learning*](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)  
- **Bishop, C.M. (2006).** [*Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/)  
- **Szeliski, R. (2010).** [*Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications*](https://szeliski.org/Book/)  
- **Manning, C.D., Raghavan, P., & Schütze, H. (2010).** [*Introduction to Information Retrieval*](https://www-nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/)
- **Topol, E. (2019).** [*Deep Medicine*](https://www.amazon.ca/Deep-Medicine-Artificial-Intelligence-Healthcare/dp/1541644638)

Enjoy the journey and happy learning!
